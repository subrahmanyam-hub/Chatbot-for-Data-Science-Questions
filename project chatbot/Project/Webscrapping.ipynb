      "1) What is Machine learning?\n",
      "Machine learning is a branch of computer science which deals with system programming in order to automatically learn and improve with experience.  For example: Robots are programed so that they can perform the task based on data they gather from sensors. It automatically learns programs from data.\n",
      "2) Mention the difference between Data Mining and Machine learning? \n",
      "Machine learning relates with the study, design and development of the algorithms that give computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  While, data mining can be defined as the process in which the unstructured data tries to extract knowledge or unknown interesting patterns.  During this process machine, learning algorithms are used.\n",
      "3) What is ‘Overfitting’ in Machine learning?\n",
      "In machine learning, when a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of underlying relationship ‘overfitting’ occurs.  When a model is excessively complex, overfitting is normally observed, because of having too many parameters with respect to the number of training data types. The model exhibits poor performance which has been overfit.\n",
      "4) Why overfitting happens?\n",

      "19) What are the advantages of Naive Bayes?\n",
      "In Naïve Bayes classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models like logistic regression, so you need less training data.  The main advantage is that it can’t learn interactions between features.\n",
      "20) In what areas Pattern Recognition is used?\n",
      "Pattern Recognition can be used in\n",
      "21) What is Genetic Programming?\n",
      "Genetic programming is one of the two techniques used in machine learning. The model is based on the testing and selecting the best choice among a set of results.\n",
      "22) What is Inductive Logic Programming in Machine Learning?\n",
      "Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a subfield of machine learning which uses logical programming representing background knowledge and examples.\n",
      "23) What is Model Selection in Machine Learning?\n",
      "The process of selecting models among different mathematical models, which are used to describe the same data set is known as Model Selection. Model selection is applied to the fields of statistics, machine learning and data mining.\n",

      "26) What is the difference between heuristic for rule learning and heuristics for decision trees?\n",
      "The difference is that the heuristics for decision trees evaluate the average quality of a number of disjointed sets while rule learners only evaluate the quality of the set of instances that is covered with the candidate rule.\n",
      "27) What is Perceptron in Machine Learning?\n",
      "In Machine Learning, Perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm for binary classifiers where a binary classifier is a deciding function of whether an input represents a vector or a number.\n",
      "28) Explain the two components of Bayesian logic program?\n",
      "Bayesian logic program consists of two components.  The first component is a logical one ; it consists of a set of Bayesian Clauses, which captures the qualitative structure of the domain.  The second component is a quantitative one, it encodes the quantitative information about the domain.\n",
      "29) What are Bayesian Networks (BN) ?\n",
      "Bayesian Network is used to represent the graphical model for probability relationship among a set of variables.\n",
