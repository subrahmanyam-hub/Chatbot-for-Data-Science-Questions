0,Data Science,1) What is Machine learning?,Machine learning is a branch of computer science which deals with system programming in order to automatically learn and improve with experience.  For example: Robots are programed so that they can perform the task based on data they gather from sensors. It automatically learns programs from data.
1,Data Science,2) Mention the difference between Data Mining and Machine learning? ,"Machine learning relates with the study, design and development of the algorithms that give computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  While, data mining can be defined as the process in which the unstructured data tries to extract knowledge or unknown interesting patterns.  During this process machine, learning algorithms are used."
2,Data Science,3) What is ‘Overfitting’ in Machine learning?,"In machine learning, when a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of underlying relationship ‘overfitting’ occurs.  When a model is excessively complex, overfitting is normally observed, because of having too many parameters with respect to the number of training data types. The model exhibits poor performance which has been overfit."
3,Data Science,4) Why overfitting happens?,The possibility of overfitting exists as the criteria used for training the model is not the same as the criteria used to judge the efficacy of a model.
4,Data Science,5) How can you avoid overfitting ?,"In this technique,  a model is usually given a dataset of a known data on which training (training data set) is run and a dataset of unknown data against which the model is tested. The idea of cross validation is to define a dataset to “test” the model in the training phase."
5,Data Science,6) What is inductive machine learning?,"The inductive machine learning involves the process of learning by examples, where a system, from a set of observed instances tries to induce a general rule."
6,Data Science,10) What is the standard approach to supervised learning?,The standard approach to supervised learning is to split the set of example into the training set and the test.
7,Data Science,11) What is ‘Training set’ and ‘Test set’?,"In various areas of information science like machine learning, a set of data is used to discover the potentially predictive relationship known as ‘Training Set’. Training set is an examples given to the learner, while Test set is used to test the accuracy of the hypotheses generated by the learner, and it is the set of example held back from the learner. Training set are distinct from Test set."
8,Data Science,17) What is the difference between artificial learning and machine learning?,Machine learning in where mathematical foundations is independent of any particular classifier or learning algorithm is referred as algorithm independent machine learning?
9,Data Science,18) What is classifier in machine learning?,"Designing and developing algorithms according to the behaviours based on empirical data are known as Machine Learning.  While artificial intelligence in addition to machine learning, it also covers other aspects like knowledge representation, natural language processing, planning, robotics etc."
10,Data Science,19) What are the advantages of Naive Bayes?,"A classifier in a Machine Learning is a system that inputs a vector of discrete or continuous feature values and outputs a single discrete value, the class."
11,Data Science,21) What is Genetic Programming?,"In Naïve Bayes classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models like logistic regression, so you need less training data.  The main advantage is that it can’t learn interactions between features."
12,Data Science,22) What is Inductive Logic Programming in Machine Learning?,Genetic programming is one of the two techniques used in machine learning. The model is based on the testing and selecting the best choice among a set of results.
13,Data Science,23) What is Model Selection in Machine Learning?,Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a subfield of machine learning which uses logical programming representing background knowledge and examples.
14,Data Science,24) What are the two methods used for the calibration in Supervised Learning?,"The process of selecting models among different mathematical models, which are used to describe the same data set is known as Model Selection. Model selection is applied to the fields of statistics, machine learning and data mining."
15,Data Science,25) Which method is frequently used to prevent overfitting?,"The two methods used for predicting good probabilities in Supervised Learning areThese methods are designed for binary classification, and it is not trivial."
16,Data Science,26) What is the difference between heuristic for rule learning and heuristics for decision trees?,When there is sufficient data ‘Isotonic Regression’ is used to prevent an overfitting issue.
17,Data Science,27) What is Perceptron in Machine Learning?,The difference is that the heuristics for decision trees evaluate the average quality of a number of disjointed sets while rule learners only evaluate the quality of the set of instances that is covered with the candidate rule.
18,Data Science,28) Explain the two components of Bayesian logic program?,"In Machine Learning, Perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm for binary classifiers where a binary classifier is a deciding function of whether an input represents a vector or a number."
19,Data Science,29) What are Bayesian Networks (BN) ?,"Bayesian logic program consists of two components.  The first component is a logical one ; it consists of a set of Bayesian Clauses, which captures the qualitative structure of the domain.  The second component is a quantitative one, it encodes the quantitative information about the domain."
20,Data Science,30) Why instance based learning algorithm sometimes referred as Lazy learning algorithm?,Bayesian Network is used to represent the graphical model for probability relationship among a set of variables.
21,Data Science,31) What are the two classification methods that SVM ( Support Vector Machine) can handle?,Instance based learning algorithm is also referred as Lazy learning algorithm as they delay the induction or generalization process until classification is performed.
22,Data Science,32) What is ensemble learning?,"To solve a particular computational program, multiple models such as classifiers or experts are strategically generated and combined. This process is known as ensemble learning."
23,Data Science,33) Why ensemble learning is used?,"Ensemble learning is used to improve the classification, prediction, function approximation etc of a model."
24,Data Science,34) When to use ensemble learning?,Ensemble learning is used when you build component classifiers that are more accurate and independent from each other.
25,Data Science,35) What are the two paradigms of ensemble methods?,The two paradigms of ensemble methods are
26,Data Science,36) What is the general principle of an ensemble method and what is bagging and boosting in ensemble method?,The general principle of an ensemble method is to combine the predictions of several models built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve robustness over a single model.  Bagging is a method in ensemble for improving unstable estimation or classification schemes.  While boosting method are used sequentially to reduce the bias of the combined model.  Boosting and Bagging both can reduce errors by reducing the variance term.
27,Data Science,37) What is bias-variance decomposition of classification error in ensemble method?,The expected error of a learning algorithm can be decomposed into bias and variance. A bias term measures how closely the average classifier produced by the learning algorithm matches the target function.  The variance term measures how much the learning algorithm’s prediction fluctuates for different training sets.
28,Data Science,38) What is an Incremental Learning algorithm in ensemble?,Incremental learning method is the ability of an algorithm to learn from new data that may be available after classifier has already been generated from already available dataset.
29,Data Science,"39) What is PCA, KPCA and ICA used for?","PCA (Principal Components Analysis), KPCA ( Kernel based Principal Component Analysis) and ICA ( Independent Component Analysis) are important feature extraction techniques used for dimensionality reduction."
30,Data Science,40) What is dimension reduction in Machine Learning?,"In Machine Learning and statistics, dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under considerations and can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction."
31,Data Science,41) What are support vector machines?,Support vector machines are supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression analysis.
